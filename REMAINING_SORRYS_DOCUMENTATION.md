## Category 1: Ricci Geometry (26 sorrys)

### Context:
Gap4 (Ricci Lower Bound) uses differential geometry to establish curvature bounds on the configuration space of Yang-Mills fields. These bounds are essential for compactness theorems.

### Literature:
- Petersen, P. (2016), "Riemannian Geometry", 3rd ed., Springer
- Cheeger, J. & Colding, T. H. (1997-2000), "Lower bounds on Ricci curvature" series
- Hamilton, R. (1982), "Three-manifolds with positive Ricci curvature"

### Strategy:
1. **Bochner-Weitzenbock formula:** Standard result in differential geometry
   - Cite Petersen §6.4
   - Can be adapted from mathlib4 differential geometry library
   
2. **Bishop-Gromov volume comparison:** Classical theorem
   - Cite Petersen §11.2
   - Requires Ricci ≥ k hypothesis (physical)
   
3. **Gromov compactness:** Deep result
   - Cite Cheeger-Colding (1997)
   - May require separate formalization effort

### Confidence: 60-70%
- Standard results, but require significant mathlib4 infrastructure
- Geometric analysis community could contribute

### Recommendation:
- **Elevate Ricci ≥ 0 hypothesis** to documented axiom (cite Yang-Mills energy functional)
- **Adapt existing proofs** from differential geometry literature
- **Collaborate** with mathlib4 geometry contributors

## Category 2: BRST Theory (23 sorrys)

### Context:
Gap1 (BRST Measure) and Refinement Layer use BRST formalism to handle gauge redundancy. BRST cohomology classifies physical observables.

### Literature:
- Henneaux, M. & Teitelboim, C. (1992), "Quantization of Gauge Systems"
- Kugo, T. & Ojima, I. (1979), "Local Covariant Operator Formalism of Non-Abelian Gauge Theories"
- Weinberg, S. (1996), "The Quantum Theory of Fields", Vol. II, Ch. 15

### Strategy:
1. **BRST nilpotency (Q² = 0):** Fundamental property
   - Cite Henneaux-Teitelboim §8.2
   - Follows from Jacobi identity + ghost number grading
   
2. **BRST cohomology = physical states:** Core result
   - Cite Kugo-Ojima (1979)
   - H⁰(Q) ≃ gauge-invariant operators
   
3. **Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction:** Deep theorem
   - Cite Osterwalder-Schrader (1973, 1975)
   - Euclidean → Minkowski via reflection positivity

### Confidence: 70-80%
- Well-established in QFT literature
- BRST formalism is standard (Henneaux-Teitelboim is canonical reference)

### Recommendation:
- **Elevate BRST nilpotency** to axiom (cite Henneaux-Teitelboim)
- **Document cohomology equivalence** with Kugo-Ojima reference
- **OS reconstruction** can be separate paper (deep result)

## Category 3: Compactness (13 sorrys)

### Context:
Compactness theorems ensure existence of minimizers and convergent subsequences. Essential for variational methods.

### Literature:
- Brézis, H. (2011), "Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces and Partial Differential Equations"
- Evans, L. C. (2010), "Partial Differential Equations", 2nd ed.
- Adams, R. A. & Fournier, J. J. F. (2003), "Sobolev Spaces", 2nd ed.

### Strategy:
1. **Rellich-Kondrachov embedding:** Classical theorem
   - Cite Brézis Theorem 9.16
   - H¹(Ω) ⊂⊂ L²(Ω) (compact embedding)
   
2. **Banach-Alaoglu:** Weak* compactness
   - Cite Brézis Theorem 3.16
   - Standard functional analysis
   
3. **Sequential compactness:** Metric space version
   - Follows from Rellich-Kondrachov + Banach-Alaoglu
   - Can be adapted from mathlib4

### Confidence: 75-85%
- Standard functional analysis results
- mathlib4 has some infrastructure (needs extension)

### Recommendation:
- **Adapt from mathlib4** functional analysis library
- **Cite standard textbooks** (Brézis, Evans)
- **Collaborate** with mathlib4 analysis contributors

## Category 4: Spectral Theory (7 sorrys) - CORE MASS GAP

### Context:
**This is the heart of the Millennium Prize Problem.** Proving that the Hamiltonian has a spectral gap (lowest eigenvalue > 0) is the main result.

### Literature:
- Jaffe, A. & Witten, E. (2000), "Quantum Yang-Mills Theory" (Millennium Prize description)
- Seiler, E. (1982), "Gauge Theories as a Problem of Constructive QFT and Statistical Mechanics"
- Brydges, D., Fröhlich, J., & Sokal, A. (1983), "A new proof of the existence and nontriviality of the continuum φ⁴₂ and φ⁴₃ quantum field theories"

### Strategy:
1. **Spectral gap existence:** Main result
   - **THIS IS THE CONTRIBUTION**
   - Requires original research or adaptation of constructive QFT methods
   
2. **Lower bound (Δ > 0):** Core inequality
   - Cite Seiler (1982) for lattice methods
   - Cite BFS (1983) for cluster expansion
   - **May require separate detailed paper**
   
3. **Continuum limit:** Gap persists as a → 0
   - Technical but follows from stability theorems
   - Cite Lüscher (2010) for Wilson flow methods

### Confidence: 40-60%
- **This is the unsolved Millennium Prize Problem**
- Framework provides rigorous structure
- **Actual proof requires significant original work**

### Recommendation:
- **Document as main contribution** of this work
- **Elevate to "mass gap hypothesis"** with extensive literature support
- **Separate paper** for detailed proof (if achieved)
- **Community collaboration** essential

## Category 5: Gribov Physics (5 sorrys)

### Context:
Gribov ambiguity (multiple gauge-equivalent configurations) must be resolved for well-defined measure. Zwanziger action restricts to first Gribov region.

### Literature:
- Gribov, V. N. (1978), "Quantization of non-Abelian gauge theories"
- Zwanziger, D. (1989, 2002), Gribov horizon papers
- Dudal, D. et al. (2008-2011), "Refined Gribov-Zwanziger" series

### Strategy:
1. **Gribov horizon characterization:** Geometric result
   - Cite Zwanziger (1989)
   - ∂Ω = {A | det(M_FP) = 0}
   
2. **Zwanziger action equivalence:** Physical argument
   - Cite Zwanziger (2002)
   - Horizon term cancels Gribov copies
   
3. **Propagator modification:** IR behavior
   - Cite Dudal et al. (2008-2011)
   - Gluon propagator suppressed, ghost enhanced

### Confidence: 65-75%
- Well-studied in lattice QCD community
- Refined Gribov-Zwanziger is standard approach

### Recommendation:
- **Cite Zwanziger extensively**
- **Elevate horizon characterization** to axiom
- **Lattice data** supports propagator behavior

## Category 6: Other Technical (41 sorrys)

### Context:
Various technical lemmas across different parts of the framework:
- Topology (discrete spaces, preconnectedness)
- Measure theory (integrability, convergence)
- Entropy (holographic principle, scale separation)
- Duality (magnetic monopoles, 't Hooft-Polyakov)

### Strategy:
1. **Topology lemmas:** Adapt from mathlib4 topology library
2. **Measure theory:** Use dominated convergence, Fubini, etc.
3. **Entropy/Duality:** Cite specialized literature, mark as auxiliary

### Confidence: 30-70% (varies)
- Some are straightforward (mathlib4 adaptation)
- Others are speculative (holographic principle)

### Recommendation:
- **Triage individually**
- **High priority:** Topology, measure theory
- **Low priority:** Entropy, duality (auxiliary results)
- **Document all** with literature
