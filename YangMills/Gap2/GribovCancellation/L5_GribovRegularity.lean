Assessment:

Confidence: 95%
Status: âœ… PROVEN in literature
Risk: Very Low
Decision: ACCEPT

Assessment:

Confidence: 60-70%
Status: ðŸ”„ OUR CONJECTURE (plausible but not standard)
Risk: Medium-High
Decision: TEST NUMERICALLY + REFINE FORMULATION

Gap: No theorem in literature directly states this relation globally.
Within Î©: Fixed sign (all positive) â†’ k even only (SOLID âœ…)
Across Î©: Parity jump at horizon (PLAUSIBLE ðŸŸ¡)
Global relation: Our conjecture (TESTABLE ðŸ”„)
Mitigation Strategy:

Optimal transport: match topological lumps



Assessment:

Verify: Should vanish on physical states (Q(Î¨) = 0)
Refine: If partial success, identify domain of validity
