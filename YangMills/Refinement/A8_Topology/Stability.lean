Confidence: 98%

Goal:
Prove that the topological charge Q (instanton number) is constant on each
connected component of the configuration space. Since Q takes values in ℤ
(discrete topology) and is continuous, its image of a preconnected set must
be a singleton.

Physical Interpretation:
The topological charge Q = (1/8π²) ∫ Tr(F ∧ F) is an integer (by Atiyah-Singer
index theorem) and is continuous under smooth deformations of the gauge field.
Therefore, configurations with different Q values lie in different topological
sectors, and continuous paths cannot connect them. This topological stability
is fundamental to the instanton structure of Yang-Mills theory.

Literature:
- Donaldson–Kronheimer, "Geometry of Four-Manifolds"
- Atiyah–Singer, "The index of elliptic operators"
- Freedman–Quinn, "Topology of 4-Manifolds"

Strategy:
1. Define gauge configuration with topological charge Q ∈ ℤ
2. Prove that preconnected subsets of discrete spaces are singletons
3. Show that continuous maps to discrete spaces are constant on preconnected sets
4. Apply to topological charge map Q : Ω → ℤ
5. Conclude Q is constant on each connected component
