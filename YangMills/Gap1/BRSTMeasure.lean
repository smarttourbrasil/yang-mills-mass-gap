# Gap 1: Existence of BRST-Invariant Measure

This file formalizes Theorem 2.1 (Gap 1): the existence of a well-defined,
BRST-invariant measure on the space of gauge connections.

## Strategy:
We encapsulate all required properties (invariance, finiteness, regularization)
into a single structure `BRSTMeasure`, then postulate its existence as an axiom.
This axiom is grounded in dimensional regularization and lattice QCD results.

Structure encapsulating all properties of a valid BRST measure.
A measure is valid if it satisfies:
1. BRST invariance: the measure is unchanged under BRST transformations
2. Finiteness: the partition function Z is finite
3. Dimensional regularization: the measure is well-defined in d→4 limit

AXIOM 1: Existence of BRST Measure

We postulate that there exists a measure satisfying all three properties above.
This axiom is justified by:
- Lattice QCD simulations showing finite Z
- Dimensional regularization techniques (Faddeev-Slavnov)
- Constructive field theory results in lower dimensions

This is the foundational assumption for Gap 1.

COROLLARY: Gauge Independence

The finiteness of Z implies that physical observables are gauge-independent.
This connects Gap 1 to Gap 2 (Gribov cancellation).
