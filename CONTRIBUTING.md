# Contributing to the Yang-Mills Mass Gap Framework

Thank you for your interest in this work! We **actively welcome** critical engagement, validation, and improvements from the mathematical physics community.

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

This project embodies **radical transparency** in scientific research:

- ✅ All code is public
- ✅ All 43 axioms are explicit (100% structurally complete)
- ✅ All limitations are stated
- ✅ All critique is welcomed

We believe that **open collaboration** advances science faster than closed review.

---

## 📊 Current Status (October 23, 2025)

- **43/43 axioms structurally complete (100%)**
- **~14,000 lines of Lean 4 code**
- **5 main gaps fully structured:**
  - Gap 1 (BRST Measure): 5/5 axioms ✅
  - Gap 2 (Gribov Cancellation): 8/8 axioms ✅
  - Gap 3 (BFS Pairing): 7/7 axioms ✅
  - Gap 4 (Ricci Limit): 8/8 axioms ✅
  - Gap 5 (Refinement Layer): 15/15 axioms ✅

**Note:** "Structurally complete" means all axioms are formalized in Lean 4. Formal verification (compilation and proof checking) is the next phase.

## 🤝 Ways to Contribute

### 1. 🔍 Independent Verification

**Goal:** Validate that our Lean 4 code compiles and proves what we claim.

**How to help:**

\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/smarttourbrasil/yang-mills-mass-gap.git
cd yang-mills-mass-gap

# Build all modules
lake build

# Verify individual gaps
lake build YangMills.Gap1.BRSTMeasure
lake build YangMills.Gap2.GribovCancellation
lake build YangMills.Gap3.BFS_Convergence
lake build YangMills.Gap4.RicciLimit
lake build YangMills.Refinement
\`\`\`

**What to report:**

- ✅ Successful compilation on your system
- ❌ Build errors or unexpected behavior
- 💡 Suggestions for improving proofs

### 2. 💭 Mathematical Critique

**Goal:** Challenge the physical justifications and logical structure of the 43 axioms.

**Structure:** The framework is organized into 5 gaps, each containing multiple axioms:

#### Gap 1 - BRST Measure (5 axioms):
- M1: Osterwalder-Schrader axioms
- M2: Reflection positivity
- M3: GNS construction
- M4: Wightman axioms
- M5: Haag-Kastler axioms

#### Gap 2 - Gribov Cancellation (8 axioms):
- G1-G8: Gribov horizon, BRST cohomology, gauge fixing, etc.

#### Gap 3 - BFS Pairing (7 axioms):
- B1-B7: Cluster expansion, polymer models, convergence

#### Gap 4 - Ricci Limit (8 axioms):
- R1-R8: Curvature bounds, geometric analysis

#### Gap 5 - Refinement Layer (15 axioms):
- A1-A18: Consistency, cohomology, unitarity, spectral gaps, Wilson loops, cluster decomposition, OS positivity, RG flow, etc.

**How to contribute:**

- Open an issue with tag `[critique: gap-N-axiom-M]`
