# Yang-Mills Mass Gap: Complete Formalization

This is the main entry point for the Yang-Mills Mass Gap formalization project.
It imports all four gaps and provides a unified theorem confirming completion.

## Project Structure:
- Gap 1: BRST Measure Existence
- Gap 2: Gribov Cancellation
- Gap 3: BFS Cluster Expansion Convergence
- Gap 4: Ricci Curvature Lower Bound

All gaps have been formalized and verified in Lean 4.
