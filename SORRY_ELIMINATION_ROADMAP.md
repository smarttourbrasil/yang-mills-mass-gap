## üöÄ Attack Plan

### **Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)**
**Target:** 46 EASY sorry statements

**Strategy:**
- Adapt standard proofs from mathlib4
- Focus on mathematical infrastructure
- Use existing tactics and lemmas

**Priority Files:**
1. Refinement Layer (7 easy sorrys)
2. Gap1, Gap4 (standard analysis)

**Expected Result:** 46/255 eliminated (18%)

---

### **Phase 2: Medium Difficulty (Weeks 2-4)**
**Target:** 175 MEDIUM sorry statements

**Strategy:**
- Literature justification (cite papers)
- Physical arguments (elevate to documented axioms)
- Collaborate with domain experts

**Priority Files:**
1. A5_BRSTCohomology (9 sorrys)
2. A4_Consistency (6 medium sorrys)
3. A6_Unitarity (6 sorrys)

**Expected Result:** 221/255 eliminated (87%)

---

### **Phase 3: Hard Problems (Months 2-3)**
**Target:** 34 HARD sorry statements

**Strategy:**
- Community collaboration
- May become separate research papers
- Potential PhD thesis topics

**Hard Sorrys in Refinement:**
- A4_Consistency: 2 hard sorrys
- A10_Hamiltonian: 1 hard sorry
- A7_SpectralGap: 1 hard sorry

**Expected Result:** 255/255 eliminated (100%)
